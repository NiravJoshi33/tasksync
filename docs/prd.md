## Product Requirements Document: Daily Task Logger & Slack Notifier

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 16, 2025
**Author:** Nirav
**Status:** Draft

**1. Introduction & Overview**

- **1.1. Product Name:** Daily Task Logger & Slack Notifier (Internal Codename: "TaskSync")
- **1.2. Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for TaskSync, an internal web application designed to streamline the process of daily task logging, centralize task data into Google Sheets, and provide timely automated updates to the team via Slack.
- **1.3. Problem Statement:** The current methods for logging daily tasks and communicating updates may involve manual data entry into spreadsheets and separate, manual notifications on Slack. This can lead to inefficiencies, data duplication, inconsistent reporting, delays, or missed updates, impacting team coordination and visibility.
- **1.4. Proposed Solution:** TaskSync will provide a simple, centralized web form for team members to submit their daily task updates. The application will automatically record these submissions into a designated Google Sheet and concurrently send a formatted notification to a specified Slack channel.
- **1.5. Goals & Objectives:**
  - **Efficiency:** Significantly reduce the manual effort and time spent by team members on logging and reporting daily tasks.
  - **Consistency:** Ensure all task updates are logged in a standardized format and reported reliably.
  - **Centralization:** Maintain Google Sheets as the single source of truth for all daily task records.
  - **Timeliness:** Provide near real-time (or consolidated daily) updates to the team via Slack, improving awareness of ongoing work and progress.
  - **Usability:** Offer a simple, intuitive interface that requires minimal training.

**2. Target Audience & Users**

- **2.1. Primary Users:** Internal team members who are required to log their daily tasks, progress, and any newly accomplished items.
- **2.2. Secondary Users:** Team leads, project managers, and other stakeholders who need visibility into team activities and progress through the centralized Google Sheet data and Slack notifications.

**3. User Stories**

- **US-101:** As a team member, I want to access a simple and intuitive web form **so that I can** quickly and easily log my planned tasks, new tasks accomplished, status updates, and relevant comments for the day.
- **US-102:** As a team member, I want the task submission form to auto-populate the current date, which I can override if necessary, **so that** data entry is faster.
- **US-103:** As a team member, I want the system to automatically save my submitted task details into a central, pre-configured Google Sheet **so that** there is a persistent and organized record of my work accessible to the team.
- **US-104:** As a team member, I want the system to automatically send a formatted notification to a designated Slack channel when I submit a task update **so that** my team is informed of my progress without me needing to send a separate message.
- **US-105:** As a team member, I want to receive immediate visual confirmation (e.g., a success message) after submitting a task **so that I know** the submission was processed correctly.
- **US-106:** As a team member, I want the form to have clear input fields with basic validation (e.g., for required fields) **so that I can** minimize data entry errors and ensure completeness.
- **US-107 (Optional - for V1 or V2):** As a team lead, I want an automated end-of-day summary of all tasks logged that day, fetched from Google Sheets, to be posted to a specific Slack channel **so that I can** get a consolidated overview of the team's progress without manual compilation.

            * If no user authentication, this might be a free-text field or omitted.
            * If basic user identification is possible (e.g., via SSO header if applicable, or simple name input), this should be captured. For V1, assume implicit or a simple text field if needed.
    4.1.4. **Client-Side Validation:**
        4.1.4.1. Real-time feedback for required fields.
        4.1.4.2. Indication of invalid input formats before submission.
    4.1.5. **Submission:**
        4.1.5.1. A clear "Submit Task" or "Log Update" button.
        4.1.5.2. Button should be disabled temporarily upon click to prevent multiple submissions.
    4.1.6. **User Feedback:**
        4.1.6.1. Upon successful submission: Display a clear, non-intrusive success message (e.g., "Task logged successfully!"). The form may reset or offer to log another task.
        4.1.6.2. Upon submission failure: Display a user-friendly error message indicating the nature of the problem (e.g., "Failed to connect to Google Sheets. Please try again." or "Validation error on field X.").

**4.2. Backend Logic (SvelteKit Server Routes / Form Actions)**
    4.2.1. **Data Reception:** Securely receive form data from the SvelteKit frontend.
    4.2.2. **Server-Side Validation:** Re-validate all incoming data for security and integrity.
    4.2.3. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all backend operations (API calls, data processing).

**4.3. Google Sheets Integration**
    4.3.1. **Authentication:** Securely authenticate with the Google Sheets API using a service account (OAuth 2.0). Credentials must not be exposed to the client-side.
    4.3.2. **Data Storage:**
        4.3.2.1. Upon successful form processing, the backend will append the task details as a new row to a pre-configured Google Sheet.
        4.3.2.2. The target Google Sheet ID and specific sheet name (e.g., "Daily Tasks") will be configurable via environment variables.
    4.3.3. **Sheet Structure:** The Google Sheet will contain columns such as: `Submission Timestamp`, `Date (from form)`, `Task Description`, `Task Type`, `Status`, `Comments`, `Submitted By (if captured)`.
    4.3.4. **Failure Management:** If writing to Google Sheets fails, the system should log the error. For critical internal use, a retry mechanism could be considered, or at least clear error reporting to an admin.

**4.4. Slack Integration**
    4.3.1. **Authentication:** Securely authenticate with the Slack API using a Bot User OAuth Token or an Incoming Webhook URL. Credentials must not be exposed to the client-side.
    4.3.2. **Notification Trigger:** A Slack notification is sent immediately after a task is successfully processed by the backend (and ideally written to Google Sheets).
    4.3.3. **Notification Content (Real-time per submission):**
        4.3.3.1. The message will be sent to a pre-configured Slack channel (configurable via environment variable).
        4.3.3.2. The message will be formatted for readability using Slack's `mrkdwn` (e.g., bolding, newlines).
        4.3.3.3. Content should include: Date, Task Description, Status, Comments, and Submitter (if available). Example:
            ```
            *New Task Update*
            *Date:* 2025-05-16
            *Task:* Refactor user authentication module.
            *Type:* Planned
            *Status:* In Progress
            *Comments:* Making good progress, expect to complete by EOD.
            *By:* [User Name/Identifier if available]
            ```
    4.3.4. **Failure Management:** If sending to Slack fails, the system should log the error. The failure to send to Slack should not prevent the data from being written to Google Sheets.

**4.5. (Optional V1/V2 Feature) End-of-Day Summary to Slack**
    4.5.1. **Trigger:** A scheduled mechanism (e.g., external cron job calling a dedicated SvelteKit API endpoint, or platform-specific scheduled function like Vercel Cron Jobs) will run once daily at a configurable time (e.g., 6:00 PM Team Time).
    4.5.2. **Data Retrieval:** The triggered SvelteKit backend function will fetch all task entries for the current date from the Google Sheet.
    4.5.3. **Message Formatting:** Consolidate all retrieved tasks into a single, well-formatted summary message. The message may group tasks by user, type, or status.
    4.5.4. **Posting to Slack:** Send the formatted summary message to the designated Slack channel.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

```
**5.1. Performance:**
    * Web form initial load time: < 3 seconds on a standard desktop connection.
    * Task submission processing time (from form submit to success/error feedback, including Sheets & Slack updates): < 5 seconds under normal conditions.
**5.2. Usability:**
    * The application must be highly intuitive, requiring minimal to no training for team members.
    * Error messages must be clear and actionable.
    * Consistent look and feel across the application.
**5.3. Reliability & Availability:**
    * Target uptime: 99.9% (for an internal tool, brief maintenance windows are acceptable if communicated).
    * The system must gracefully handle temporary unavailability of Google Sheets or Slack APIs (e.g., log data to Sheets even if Slack notification fails and report the Slack error).
**5.4. Security:**
    * All API keys, service account credentials, and Slack tokens must be stored securely as private environment variables on the server, inaccessible to the client-side.
    * Communication with Google Sheets and Slack APIs must use HTTPS.
    * No sensitive user data beyond task details should be stored unless explicitly required and secured.
**5.5. Maintainability:**
    * The SvelteKit codebase must be well-organized, modular, and include comments for complex logic.
    * Configuration parameters (Sheet ID, Slack Channel ID, etc.) must be managed through environment variables.
**5.6. Scalability:**
    * The application should comfortably handle submissions from a team of up to 50-100 users making multiple submissions daily.
    * The Google Sheets solution is inherently scalable for this volume of data.
```

**6. Design and UX Considerations**

```
* **Simplicity & Clarity:** The primary design principle is simplicity. The UI should be clean, uncluttered, and focused on efficient task submission.
* **Visual Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for actions (e.g., loading indicators during submission, success/error banners or toasts).
* **Responsive Layout:** While primarily for desktop, the form should be usable on tablet-sized screens. Full mobile optimization is a secondary concern for V1.
* **Accessibility (Basic):** Adhere to basic web accessibility standards (e.g., keyboard navigability for form fields, proper labeling).
```

**7. Technical Considerations**

```
* **Primary Technology:** SvelteKit (full-stack application).
    * Frontend: Svelte components.
    * Backend: SvelteKit server routes or form actions (running in a Node.js environment).
* **External APIs:**
    * Google Sheets API v4.
    * Slack API (Web API preferred for flexibility over simple Incoming Webhooks).
* **Authentication with APIs:**
    * Google Sheets: OAuth 2.0 with a Google Cloud Service Account.
    * Slack: Bot User OAuth Token.
* **Deployment:** The SvelteKit application will be deployed to a suitable environment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, internal Node.js server, Docker container). The choice of SvelteKit adapter will depend on the hosting environment.
* **Environment Variables:** Critical for managing API keys, Sheet IDs, Slack channel IDs, and other configurations without hardcoding.
```

**8. Success Metrics**

```
* **Adoption Rate:** >80% of target team members using the tool for daily logging within 1 month of launch.
* **Tasks Logged:** Average number of tasks logged per user per day meets or exceeds previous manual logging rates.
* **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback measured through informal team discussions or a simple feedback survey (e.g., average rating of >4/5 on ease of use).
* **Time Savings:** Qualitative feedback indicating a reduction in time spent on manual task reporting.
* **Data Integrity:** Reduction in incomplete or inconsistently formatted task logs in Google Sheets.
* **System Stability:** <1 critical submission failure per week due to application error.
```

**9. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements (Post V1.0)**

```
* **User Authentication:** Implement simple user authentication (e.g., OAuth with Google Workspace) to auto-populate "Submitted By" and potentially filter views.
* **In-App Task Viewing:** A separate section in the app to view/filter tasks directly from Google Sheets (read-only for V1 of this feature).
* **Task Editing/Deletion:** Ability for users to edit or delete their own recent submissions (with appropriate controls and logging).
* **Drafts & Templates:** Allow users to save task drafts or create templates for recurring tasks.
* **Enhanced Reporting:** Basic in-app reports or charts based on Google Sheet data.
* **File Attachments:** Allow users to attach small files or links to task updates.
* **Customizable Slack Notifications:** More granular control over Slack message formatting and content using Block Kit.
* **Direct @mentions in Slack:** Ability to select and @mention relevant team members in the Slack notification from the form.
* **Offline Support:** Basic PWA capabilities to allow form entry offline, syncing when back online (complex).
```

**10. Out of Scope (for V1.0)**

```
* Advanced project management features (e.g., dependencies, Gantt charts, resource allocation).
* Complex user role and permission management.
* Real-time multi-user collaboration on the form itself.
* Mobile-specific native application (iOS/Android).
* Integration with other third-party services beyond Google Sheets and Slack.
* Full PWA offline capabilities.
```
